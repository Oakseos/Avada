							<p>I am writing to support the application of Felix Ilerioluwa Aladetan for admission into the Master of
				Integrated Water Management scholarship in your organization.
				I have known Mr. Felix for more than three years. He has worked as a trainee hydrogeologist, quality
				control and assurance officer and currently serves as our technical project manager for WASH emergency. He is
				known for his dexterity and competence when it comes to projects planning and managing the day-to-day running
				of sites.</p>

							<p>His passion for water management, <a href=""> sanitation and hygiene is evident in his personal research in the study</a> of the causes and solution for water pollution in his own place of birth; an oil rich community surrounded with
				water but yet no access to sustainable and safe portable water for domestic consumption. The data from this
				research has help the Local Government to identify major causes of water pollution, best depth for good aquifer
				for the whole community. Not only this, the report aid in making informed decision about the boreholes for the
				whole community. He is also an advocate for personal and collective hygiene in the community by to sensitize
				his native tribesmen through practical sensitization and inclusive discussions on the importance of personal and
				collective hygiene and how best to report any form of oil spillage by oil firms</p>

							<p>As a WASH Volunteer consultant , He has participated in geological and geophysical studies for sub
				regional development of ground water exploration at some basement complex terrain in the Northern part of Ondo
				state and he has demonstrated his expertise by advising in areas such as site selection, waste management, pump
				test, verification of water quality, and restoration of contaminated sites</p>

							<p>He communicates and writes very well in English language, and from his exemplary academic and
				professional records, I am positive that Mr. Aladetan will prove to be one of your brilliant students owing to his
				strong analytical skill and his ability to pick concepts and apply them to real world problems. Therefore, I strongly
				recommend him for admission into the postgraduate integrated water management scholarship in your prestigious
				organization as this would improve his professional capacity to contribute to the development of the government
				planned WASH programmes in Ondo state and in Nigeria as a whole.</p>
